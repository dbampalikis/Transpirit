# Transpirit
A small RPG gaming trial

Transpirit is part of a small 2D RPG game, designed and developed for the course entitled "Game Development with Java".
There are many stuff missing, to be able to speak for a fully operating game, but I promise that I will get back to this one soon

Feel free to use code or any other aspect that might be useful for you
